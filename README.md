# Hi there, I'm Kaleb Gordon! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a data scientist with a background in Astronomy and Astrophysics. I'm passionate about exploring and analyzing data to uncover meaningful insights. I enjoy working on projects that involve data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Experience
I currently have two positions in the realm of data science.

### Synthetaic
- At Synthetaic, I leverage the rapid automatic image categorization (RAIC) tool to efficiently collect and analyze data
generated by artificial intelligence. Proactively volunteer and take on additional roles to provide exceptional and accurate insights. Employ the RAIC tool to extract valuable insights from diverse datasets including images, videos, and geospatial data for high-profile clients.

You can learn more about Synthetaic via our [website](https://www.synthetaic.com/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/Synthetaic?s=20), or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/synthetaic/mycompany/).

### City of Mansfield Utility Billing Department
- I bring valuable insights to the utility billing department by collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data to identify key trends and patterns. Develop descriptive reports that effectively convey findings to relevant members of the city government such as the city council. Through my work, I ensure the efficient and effective delivery of recommendations to optimize the utility billing departmentâ€™s performance.
